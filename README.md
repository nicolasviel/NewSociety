# How To: build a fair and prosperous society

In many societies, citizens struggle. Struggle for living, pay school, pay home, pay food, pay health care. Things that normaly everyone should have. In order to focus on more valuable things.

Currently, with the help of the new technologies emerged during the last 15 years, it is possible to identify fundamental principles for building `societies without poverty`. And where `people are free to focus on what they want, and free to create wealth or not`.

Theses technologies are `Bitcoin`, `Smart Contracts`, `Central Bank Digital Currency`, `Robotization`, `Artificial Intelligence`, and `Open Data`.

Correctly used together, it is possible to create a robust set of 8 principles that can be applied in all societies around the world. And definively remove poverty and dramatically increase wealth and quality of life in the world.

## About societies implementing a Universal Income

In those societies, a large part of the population will choose to live only from the Universal Income, without working and just enjoying life. But they will live with a Minimal Acceptable Lifestyle, just above the level of poverty. And the Universal Income will protect the life of all others who have not the possibility to work: students, retired peoples, and all the others. Also, companies will need to make their job offers more attractive, and working conditions will increase dramaticaly because people will not be forced to work.
