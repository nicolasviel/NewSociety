### 3 Governments have a high control on the usage of money
`The use of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) with smart contracts allows the implementation of a smart Universal Income.`

- An official CBDC wallet is provisioned for each citizen and it is managed by Central Bank and governments. 
- Each citizen can create and manage additional CBDC wallets for their own purpose.
- Governments can fix usage on money sent to citizens: financial assistance for health care can only be spent for this purpose.
- Governments can send the Universal Income to each citizen in their official CBDC wallet with fixed usages: expiration delay, allowed only for consuming.

### 4 Every citizen have, at least, a Minimum Acceptable Lifestyle
